<h2>Interaction of User with the Application</h2>
<h3>Login and Submit Feedback</h3>
<p>Following flowchat explains how the user interacts with application while performing the login operation 
and submitting the feedback. User provides the login details on the application home page. The website then refers to the databse
to validate the credentails. A stored procedure named usp_ValidateUser is run to check the validtity of the user by refering 
the credentails provided in the table tbl_userDetails for that user. Similarly while submitting the feedback a stored
procedure named usp_SubmitFeedback is used to write data into the table tbl_feedback.
The submission of the feedback functionality is now removed as per the instructions from professor. But I have implemented
the code and is now commented and present on the page.</p>

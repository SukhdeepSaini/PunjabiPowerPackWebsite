<h2>My Motivation - “Stay Fit, Live Healthy”</h2>

<p>I have been into bodybuilding for quite so long as it is my hobby and I have deep interest in the field of bodybuilding. I also have good domain knowledge regarding the same. 
It has always been in my mind to develop a website which is related to body building which will be used by different 
users to stay fit. I have used the platform provided by our web development course to develop this website which
 may be used in future by northeastern Marino center or me in order to advertise or sell different bodybuilding products.</p>

 <h3>Bodybuilding and Fitness</h3>
 <p>I have always been researching on the topics related to bodybuilding and always tries to find solution to the various health related
 challenges and problems that people faces in real world. I got inspriration from my family who have been into medical field as my father
 being a doctor and mother being a staff Nurse. I done proper ethnography regarding what all features should be incorporated in the website so 
 as to deliver a complete website that would address all the health related aspects.<br /><br />
 I have considered the following Points while developing the website:
 
 <ul>
 <li>Diet</li>
 <li>Fitness Information</li>
 <li>Workout</li>
 <li>Motivation</li>
 </ul></p>


 <h3>The Real World Problem it Solves</h3>
 <p>I have worked previously in IT industry and I know that people does not focus much on their health as soon as they enter industry
 and starts working. The condition is the same in colleges also , Students always eat junk food like Pizza , Burgers which 
 are not good for health because of which many health related problems are arising. The website addrss all the health related aspects starting
 from information on Diet i.e. helping users with healthy recipes to buying of bodybuilding products. It also provide users with information
 on workout routines. Users can watch video and can also read articles on health and fitness to get complete information on how
 to make their life better and stay fit.<strong> This website is complete package to address all the health realted issues that this Modern 
 world faces.</strong></p>

<p>I have developed the complete website of my own starting from the scratch. I have written the entire code for all the aspx, aspx.cs, HTML , CSS, Javascript and JQuey files.
I have used CSS for from Bootstrap for some of the features  like for the implementing of the image carousal present on the website. I have carefully designed and developed 
every feature present on the website.I am hoping that every user will have the best user experience while performing any task.</p>

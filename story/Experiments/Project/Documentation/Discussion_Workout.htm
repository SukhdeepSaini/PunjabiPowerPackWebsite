<p>The workout page displays static data which is hardcoded and the results are shown as per the values
selected by the user in the dropdowns present on the workout page. I have used a iframe tag on the page
which dynamically changes the value of the source attribute for the iframe based on the selection made by
the user for the excercise video he wants to see.</p>

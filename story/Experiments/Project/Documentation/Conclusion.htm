<h2>Future Enhancements - This is not the END</h2>
<p>I have interest in web development and I am linking it and now its becoming a hobby for me. Checking new web technologies,
learning new things is now part of my daily schedule. I get at least some time from my day to look into web development stuff. I have thought of many enhancements to
the current website I have developed and I will making those enhancements very soon.</p>
<h3>Following are the enhancements I have though of right now</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yelp API :</strong> I am thinking to implement this API so as to locate the restaurants from where users
can have their favourite\healthy food.</li>
<li><strong>Tracking Progress for fitness :</strong> The website will allow users to track their fitness and provide customized workout plans
based on time frames and days. They will be having more flexibility while getting the workout plans. I will be implementing some 
efficient algorithm for this.</li>
<li><strong>Paypal API :</strong> All the checkout of the products should be handled securely at the website. I am thinking to use an API like
PayPal for this so that the verification of credit\debit card details can be done at website and users can pay using theri Paypal
account also at the website for the products they will buy.</li>
<li><strong>Youtube API Enhancement :</strong>Currently the user is redirected to youtube whenever he searches for a new video or wants to see any featured video. I will be 
modifying the code to display the video on the website for all the videos the user searches.</li>
<li><strong>Google ADS API:</strong> I will be displaying adds for featured bodybuilding products using the google ADS API on my websie.</li>

</ul>

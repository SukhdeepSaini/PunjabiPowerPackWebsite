<h3>All Pages done and uploaded</h3>

<p>I have implemented the functionality of every page listed on my website and now I am in process of testing it. I have 
checked once that all the API calls are happening and and proper data is getting displayed on the website. As of for now
I have implemented four API's and they are <strong>Ebay Search API , Youtube Search API , Yummly Recipe API , Deepfitness Articles API.</strong>
Three of the API's I have implemented are restfull and the response they give is in Jsonp. One of the API i.e. Deepfitness is SOAP based
and it responds back with XML data. There was error coming on with the size limit for the response for the SOAP based API. Some times
it was working fine and some times it was giving me an error. I have changed the web.config file to handle the large size response and I am
hoping that the code will not break at any time.<br />
<strong>Feeling Hopefull to get Good grade in the course.</strong></p>

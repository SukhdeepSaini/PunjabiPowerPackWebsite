<h3>Continuing Research on Project</h3>

<p>
I have started doing research on the API's which I will be using in my project . I finished finalizing the project requirements both functional
and non functional for the project and developed wire frames and use cases by researching on the web. I will be discussing some of the
features I have identified with my project with rohan and prof in order to ensure the feasibility considering the time constraint.</p>

<h3>Trying to implement the responsive design</h3>

<p>
I was trying to implement the responsive design on my home page as per the comment provide by rohan and was facing issues while implementing bootstrap.
Some of the predefined CSS in the bootstrap template was not working fine with the page I created. I tried to resolve the problem by looking 
into some tutorial videos for bootstrap. Many issues were resolved but still I am struggling resolving some issues. I will try to resolve the issues during TA hours by discussing the
issues with my TA.

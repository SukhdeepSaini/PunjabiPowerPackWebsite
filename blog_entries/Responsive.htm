<h3>Responsive Webpage</h3>

<p>
I was facing some dificulties implementing and understanding the responsive web pages . I went through few online tutorials and read the bootstrap
documentation to have through understanding of what exactly is responsive design and how to apporach the things in right way to implememt that in our
websites.
</p>
<p>I went through the tutorials of Bootstrap and wordpress and implemented both of them in my experiments.I have created few dummy pages using
wordpress and hosted it on free hosting website. Clicking on the link for my name on my homepage will navigate the user to the wordpress site I have been developing.
As it is a free hosting website , sometimes the link may not work because of resouce constraints. I am learning new technologies every day and
trying to implement in my experiments and projects.</p>

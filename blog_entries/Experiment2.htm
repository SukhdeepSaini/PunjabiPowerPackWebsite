<h3>Playing aroung with JQuery and Javascript</h3>

<p>
To delve deeper into JQuery and Javascript I did through research on both of these Interesting Web Technologies. I Read the 
Content from W3Schools , JQuery.Com and practiced on the experiments. I learned new concepts as well as how to make use of pre defined functions . I initially 
faced few problems with JQuery '$(document).ready(function ()' but then figured out the solutions and was able to perform the intended function
by making use of both user defined and predefined JQuery functions. I will discuss about this in detail with my TA in the coming TA session.
</p>
<p>
In this experiments I have demonstrated how JQuery can be used in an efficient and easy way to implements some of the functions which would
have been very complex if implemented in JavaScript for example sorting the list , dragging the heading , cloning the content from DOM etc.
I learned that JQuery can be used to make our webpages more interactive and give a nice apperance and effect. It is a nicer
version of JavaScript libraries and I will try to make maximum use of it in my next experiments.</p>
<p>I also implements the bibliography , the links to source code , Css files and Javascripts file both in current as well as previous experiment
which was provided as a review comment during my first experiment.</p>

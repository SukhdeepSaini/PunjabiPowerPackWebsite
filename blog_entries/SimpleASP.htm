<h3>A Simple Experiment on ASP controls and successfully established connection to Database</h3>

<p>Implement a simple calculator compluting sum , multiplication , division and substraction of two quantities . I have used few Asp.net 
controls like textbox and button. the experiment also demonstrates the use of validator controls present in Asp like compare validator and
required field validator. I have implemented the backend logic using C# to compute the result for various operations. I tried today to connect
to SQL Server database of CCIS following the instructions on Prof Rasala's website and was able to connect to the database. </p>

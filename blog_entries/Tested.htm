<h3>Tested....Found Bugs.....Fixed Bugs....Deployed</h3>

<p>I have been working as a test engineer before and know the importance of testing the product which is going to be deployed into
production. Tomorrow is my presentation and I am feeling hopefull to give my best and for that I need to verify that my
website is running all of its functionality fine. I spent few hours today to test the application and found a couple of bugs.
The error message which which had initially stopped with the SOAP web service again started coming . I have modified the code again
to handle the changes and so as to make that functionality robust so that the project runs without any issue. A couple of other minor
cosmetic defects were identified and fixed. I am all set now for presentation tomorrow.

<strong>Feeling Hopefull :)</strong></p>

<h3>Exploring more on web services and message formats</h3>
<p>To delve depper into the field of web services I have been exploring the history of web services that how web services evolved
and what lead to the discovery of service oriented architecture. I read about the various message formats that have been used with an
HTTP request. SOAP , REST , ODATA , UDDI their history , uses and preferences and how a developer should think while choosing either
of these formats to develop a service oriented application. I explored some pretty cool web service websites just like programable
web naming few of them like 'www.xmethods.com' , 'service-repository.com'  and many more. I am continuing my research on web services
to get all the informtion required to be a successfull web developer.</p>

<h3>Finally Got Some Progress</h3>


<p>Al Last after trying so hard to implement the recipe API i got success in implementing the Yummly API. This was a litte tricky
to implement as it involves two ajax calls to be made in order to fetch the required results for a particular request. One call is made
to the recipe database to check for the particular recipe you are searching for and the second call is made after fetching the recipe ID
from the previous response and then getting the required details about that recipe. I have been trying from two days to implement such a API and was not getting
success and was always getting into erros. Finally got this into work. I will be using this experiment in my project. 

<strong>Now the API works but I have tested it so many times that the limit for making the calls is exceded :P . I will upload the experiment tomorrow.</strong></p>

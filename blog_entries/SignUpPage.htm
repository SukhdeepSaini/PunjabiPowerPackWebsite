<h3>Project Sign Up Page Added</h3>
<p>I have created a project Sign up page. Although the Signup page is not required as per our course requirement and directions from 
our Prof. as it might lead to hack on the website. I have just created the User Interface. All the basic functionalities for the registeration page is being implemented like
the validation of required enteries , the checking for comparison of passwords. I have depicted her the use of required field
validators, custom validators and compare validator controls present in ASP.NET. On successfully verifying all the details the user
is not registered but is navigated to the project home page and is alerted with a message saying that the user needs to contact the 
admin for the login credentails as no more users can be registered.</p>

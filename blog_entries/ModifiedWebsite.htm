<h3>Modified Personal Website</h3>

<p>
I tried to apply some of the concepts of jquery in my personal website. Implemented the idea of hiding and 
displaying the content on the page</br> on a click event using jquery. Also how to hide the content when a page is 
loaded for the first time.
</p>
<p>
The webpage is updated to reflect the change . On clicking the 'Me' image the information about me is getting
displayed and when clicking</br> in the text 'hide' the information is hidden and is not shown to the user.

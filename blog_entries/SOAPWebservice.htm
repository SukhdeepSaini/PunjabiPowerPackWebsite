<h3>SOAP Web Service</h3>
<p>I have created a small SOAP based web service and I am in process of making a client application to test the web service.
I have hosted the web serive on the server and right now it just depicts the operation that that the web service performs which is just the addition of
two numbers and how to call the webservice and process the response. I will be using the information to build a client for 
this small web service and will be uploading the experiment on the same shortly. Unfortunately the test function for the web serice
only works on local host but I will be making a client to test the same.</p>

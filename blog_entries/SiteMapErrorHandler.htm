<h3>Implemented Sitemap , Need Help page</h3>

<p>In order to help user with proper navigation facilities on the website. I have implemented project Sitemap page
which gives information about all the pages that are present on the website and their hierarchy . User can refer the site map 
in order to navigate to proper pages while performing their intended task. I have used the <strong>Tree navigation Asp.net control</strong>
in order to build the sitemap. Users may need help on certain small issues they might be facing while navigating on the website.
In order to address the common issues that might arise , I have created a Need Help page that contain resolution to the most common
issues that users might face while performing any task. I have also implemented the <strong>Facebook like and Share</strong>
Plugin on the need help page using which people can like and share the facebook page of punjabi power pack.</p>

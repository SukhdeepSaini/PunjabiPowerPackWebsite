<h3>SOAP Web Service implement in project</h3>

<p>I am iteratively developing my project and making changes to it every day . To add on a new functionality to my project i.e.
the users should be able to read the fitness related articles along with buying fitness products and supplements. I have used a SOAP 
based webservice developed by deepfitness.com. This webservice provide health and fitness articles and I making use of it to display articles on my 
website. The users can access fitness articles and can read any of them . The articles are updated every time user refers to the
fitness article section so that no static content is displayed on the website . I will be making use of more API's which are
relevant to the achive the goal of my website .

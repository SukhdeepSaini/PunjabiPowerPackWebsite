<h3>Issues Accessing HTML Elements</h3>
<p>I have tried using various combinations and have researched on this but still facing issues while accessing the values
for some of the HTML elements in C#. For example "textarea" , "text" and many other HTML elements whose values we need to access
and modify as per our requirements. I have posted a thread on Piazza regarding this and hopefully the issues will be resolved soon
when prof or any of the TA responds to that. Trying hard to get done with experiments and project.

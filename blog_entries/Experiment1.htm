<h3>Experiment on Basic HTML,CSS and JQuery Uploaded</h3>

<p>
I tried to implement the basic concepts of HTML5 , CSS and Jquery in experiment1 . The experiment is tested properly and updated on my website.
<br />the experiment clearly illustrated its definition and purpose . I have tried to cover most of the basic html,css tags here in the experimets.
I have used<br /> W3Schools as a refernce for implementing the concepts learned in class.
My first experiment can be access by navigating to the link 'My Experiments'<br /> present on my home page or through the 
link 'Experiments' which is displayed when user clicks the image 'ME' present on my home page.

I am hoping to learn some new interesting stuff as a part of this course and implement in my Experiments\projects in future.

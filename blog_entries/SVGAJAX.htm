<h3>Trying to work on SVG,Ajax and DB connections</h3>

<p>
I have been facing some issues trying to connect to Database. The connection is getting established on my local but when I am 
trying to implement experiments on server I am facing issues. The procedures and functions which I have created are not getting
accessed by the controls. I consulted rohan for the same but still I am facing the issues. I am trying to resolve the issues 
and will consult prof if the problem still persists. I am experimenting with different Ajax controls and API's and will update them 
on server soon.
I will

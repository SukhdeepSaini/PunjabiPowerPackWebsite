<h3>Working on Json response for a web service API</h3>

<p>
I tried to implement Yelp API and youtube API but I am facing a litte difficulty in calling the web service and parsing the response.
I will be getting in touch with Rohan to dicsuss about the Issues going on and how to fix them . I went through the examples provided by Prof. 
on Json and I am trying to learn the concepts and to implement in the experiments. I have started with the database connectivity and will be uploading 
the experiment for that this weekend.

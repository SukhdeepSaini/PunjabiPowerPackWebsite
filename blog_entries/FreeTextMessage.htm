<h3>Implemented sending of Free text message functionality</h3>
<p>I used the mail library of .Net and customize it to send messages on cell phones using the mail functionality.
I did some research and found that every cell number can be used as a mailing address and we can get the information regarding 
that from the service provider that how we can access the mail account using the cell phone number. I used that information and
and created a function that sends emails which are receieved on the cell phones as text messages.</p>

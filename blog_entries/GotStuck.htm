<h3>Got Stuck</h3>

<p>I have been trying to find a recipe API which I can use to display healthy nutritional recipes to users. I have tried multiple API's and getting errors every time.
Some weird errors are coming when I am trying to make a rest call. Errors related to MIME text and invalid tokens in response. I am struggling to fix all these up.
Will try to resolve them or will get in touch with TA to resolve it.
Hopefully it works for me.</p>

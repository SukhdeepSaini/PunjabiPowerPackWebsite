<h3>Started on Report</h3>

<p>I have started with the report work following the directions provided by Prof. on his website. I thought of how the report should be 
structured using html, regarding the design , layout and contents. I have researched about the same by checking on the project documentations
of people who had done project previously . Inspired from some of them I have incorporated few of the design features and will be uploading few
of the intial draft versions of the report today. I have taken a course related to user experience design before and will be 
using the knowlegdge gained from the course to write my report in the best way possible. While creating my website also I have followed all
the principles of user experince design so as to provide user a better user experience.</p>

<h3>Implemented Error Handling pages</h3>

<p>To make my website more robut I have been working on to handle the error conditions and exceptions that might come and then can confuse the user 
.To provide a better user friendly environment I have taken care of all the errors that can come and when ever those errors are 
generated then the user is presented with a friendly error message page through which user can navigate back and then perform its 
intented function. I have designed this error page of my own and have modified the web. config file to handle these error conditions.
changing the custom errors tag in the system.web tag makes the things happen.</p>

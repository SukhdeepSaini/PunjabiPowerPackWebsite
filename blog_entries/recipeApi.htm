<h3>Recipe API is Up and Running</h3>

<p>Finally I have implemented all the functionality of the Nutrition page on my website. After struggling so hard on implementing 
the recipe API finally I have implemented that and have made the required changes on server as well. Users can now search for their 
favourite recipe on the nutrition page and can also read the featured healthy recipes present on the webpage. There is a little issues
over here that the limit to make calls to the Yummly Api is only 100 calls per day so I will try to keep my calling rate less then a hundred for a single day.</p>
